# ml-iris-flask-app
A simple machine learning web app built for practice, using Flask as the backend and a minimal frontend with HTML and Tailwind CSS. The model is trained on the Iris dataset (from sklearn.datasets) using a Decision Tree algorithm.

Users can input flower features (sepal and petal length/width), and the app predicts the Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica). The model is serialized using pickle and integrated into the Flask app for real-time predictions.
